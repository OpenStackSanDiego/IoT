The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of IP (network) connected devices that perform repetitive actions and communication with other network devices. In this workshop, you'll be setting up some IoT devices to perform various actions.

First off, your team is going to need a name and a Twitter account. Pick a name and create a Twitter account at www.twitter.com. Your IoT devices will be posting messages to this Twitter account so you can keep track of what they are doing.

One easy way to setup IoT devices is with node-red (www.nodered.org), a visual for wiring the Internet of Things. Through this visual interface, an IoT device and be setup to run a complete workflow. Each group will be assigned a pool of IoT devices to use. At the following etherpad, type in your team name next to a pool of IoT devices. Those devices are now yours to use for the workshop.
